# Bilconnect
The aim of the project is to achieve to develop an Android application for Bilkent students.
We have a user Firebase Database to store our events and users. We verified the user by sending the
email verification to his/her email address. We have used Firebase to send the verification and
activities such as forgetting and changing passwords.He has used recycler view to achieve to print 
both users and events to a specific page(Main page and users page). We have implemented a linear 
search algorithm to search both events and users. Also, we have sorted the events by their dates. 
We have used gitkraken mainly as a Version Control System application. We have used the 
SimpleDateFormat library to get the current date in a formatted way. We all used Java to implement 
the code. In order to use out application the zip file should be extracted in Android Studio.
